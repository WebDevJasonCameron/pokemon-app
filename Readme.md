# Pokemon App | Readme

Welcome to my version of a Full Stack Pokemon Application. It is my goal to demonstrate full stack capabilities within this fun, yet productive, application. Here are the areas I will cover:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (utilizing Angular)
- Back-end: Java (utilizing Spring Boot, JPA)
- Database Management: MySQL DB and Hibernate
- APIs interactions
- Version Control: GitHub
